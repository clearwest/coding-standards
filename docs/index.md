# ClearWest Coding Standards

The purpose of this project is to house all our official coding standards under one roof.  [ClearWest](http://clearwestweb.com/) engineers and developers are expected to follow these guidelines for internal projects, and *should* follow them for external (client) projects as well, UNLESS the client has their own differing coding standards.

These standards are a combination of various sources, mixed with our own in-house experience.  Their collective purpose is to make code easier to read and maintain, minimize bugs, and be consistent across projects.

This site is a work in progress -- we've started by covering the most common languages we use every day, and will of course be adding more as soon as possible (e.g. Python, Ruby, the C's, etc.)
